A character may choose how much MP to put behind a spell

There shall be a spell tree.  Spell levels must be unlocked in succession.  

Custom spells (macro of spell and how much MP behind it) may be created.

Each character may create a list of custom spells to be used in battle.  This list has finite capacity, but may be increased by use of Upgrade Points
