# firstfantasy
My attempt to clone the first Final Fantasy game released in 1987 by SquareSoft.  Now that it's 2025, and I've had stroke #4, I'm kinda bored, and I need something to work on.  I am a bit alarmed to see how little is here.  I've collected a lot of notes over the years.  This attempt will be in Python.  The original attempt was in Java.  I will upload my notes and the three classes I have. 

My second attempt at this project was in C++.
